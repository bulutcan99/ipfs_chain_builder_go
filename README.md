# ipfs_chain_builder_go
This project revolves around querying a MySQL table to extract column names, their respective types, and cell values, structuring them into JSON format. Additionally, it integrates with IPFS for data storage and CID generation. The implementation involves constructing a chain of hashes for each row's cells, ultimately linked to an IPNS hash.
